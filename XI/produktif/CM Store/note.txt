We are located in Nairobi, Kenya along Moi Avenue.
Being an official Nike partner, we sell their shoes at convenient prices. We focus on team-designed collaborations that appeal to our global community of global independents, creatives, and free-thinkers. We create shoes to reflect the unbound lives we live and don't stop until we get it right.
